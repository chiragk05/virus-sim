# virus-sim
In the context of a Viral Infection, the program takes in the Susceptible Population, Quarantined Population, 
Infected Population, Recovery Time, Mortality Rate and the Tranmission Rate of the Virus, and visually demonstrates. 

The parameters are set at the bottom of the covid, as follows:

covid.n_susceptible = 500,
covid.n_quarantined = 50,
covid.n_infected = 10,
covid.cycles_to_fate = 1200,
covid.mortality_rate = 0.03,
covid.transmission_rate = 0.8

Those parameters have been set to certain default values, however they can be modified in the code,
In order to model whatever type of Virus which is desire.
